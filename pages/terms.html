        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing this website (saorsalabs.com) or using the Fae application ("Fae", "the Software"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use our website or software.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Software</h2>
        <h3>2.1 License</h3>
        <p>
          Fae is open source software distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0). Your use of the Fae source code is governed by the terms of that license, which can be found at <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Early Development</h3>
        <p>
          Fae is currently in active early development. The software is provided in its current state and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or behaviour that changes without notice. We make no guarantees about the stability, reliability, or fitness of the software for any particular purpose during this development phase.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Local Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Fae runs entirely on your device. You are responsible for the hardware, operating system, and environment in which Fae operates. Saorsa Labs does not host, process, or have access to any data generated by your use of Fae.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 AI-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>
          Fae uses local AI models to generate responses, analyse content, and perform tasks. AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying any output produced by Fae before relying on it.
        </p>

        <h3>2.5 Desktop Automation</h3>
        <p>
          Fae includes desktop automation capabilities that can read files, write files, and execute commands on your computer. These features include configurable safety controls (tool modes and approval gates). You are responsible for configuring appropriate safety levels and reviewing actions before approval.
        </p>

        <h2>3. The Website</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Waitlist</h3>
        <p>
          By joining our waitlist, you consent to receiving email communications about Fae's development and availability. You can unsubscribe at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@saorsalabs.com">privacy@saorsalabs.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Website Content</h3>
        <p>
          The content on this website is provided for informational purposes. While we strive for accuracy, we make no warranties about the completeness, reliability, or accuracy of information presented. Features and capabilities described may change during development.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Fae source code is licensed under AGPL-3.0. The Saorsa Labs name, Fae name, logos, and website design are the property of Saorsa Labs and may not be used without permission, except as permitted by the AGPL-3.0 license for the software itself.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          THE SOFTWARE AND WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not warrant that the software will be error-free, secure, or uninterrupted, or that defects will be corrected. You use the software entirely at your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SAORSA LABS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR WEBSITE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Fae operates locally on your device and we do not process or have access to your data, our liability for data-related issues is limited to defects in the software itself.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining the security of your device and operating system</li>
          <li>Configuring appropriate tool mode and safety settings</li>
          <li>Reviewing and verifying AI-generated content before relying on it</li>
          <li>Managing and backing up your local data</li>
          <li>Complying with applicable laws in your jurisdiction when using Fae's capabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the website or software after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Scotland. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Scottish courts.
        </p>
